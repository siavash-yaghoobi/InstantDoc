Rails telehealth application for instant scheduling of doctor's appointments. Users can search for a specialty and location and will be given relevant search results. The user can then make an appointment or enter a waitlist for an appointment. If there are no open spots, they will enter a waitlist and receive a text notification as soon as a spot opens up. They will then have a set amount of time to accept the appointment before it is given to the next person in the waitlist.
